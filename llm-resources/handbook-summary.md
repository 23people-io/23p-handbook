## Our Organization

### Organizational Structure

23people's structure is circular to foster collaboration and communication. It is organized into multidisciplinary teams, each with a clear purpose:

- **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Specialized in recruitment and retention of technological talent.
- **Sales & Growth Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Manages commercial relationships and brand growth.
- **Backoffice Services Team (BKO)**: Provides business administrative support.

These teams make up the **Iarvis Tribe**. There is also the **Drakkar Tribe**, which groups the subcontracted professionals who work for clients.

### Internal Model

Each team has autonomy around a defined purpose and offers specific services through "service APIs" that specify what they deliver, what to expect, and how to request it. Each team has:

- A **Service Request Manager (SRM)**: Focused on "what" and "when" to do.

### Position Levels and Responsibilities

Positions are structured in three main layers:
- **Direction**: Defines "what" must be achieved (strategic level).
